<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an educator who is passionate about helping my students grow and learn. 
  I take keen interest in a range of subjects, 
  from science and personal development to students support and well-being.</p>

<p> But I am not just a teacher; I am alos a learner! I have recently embarked on a new adventure,
taking a Udemy course in web development with goal of completing within the second quarter of the year.
I am excited to explore the possibilities that this new skillset will bring and 
I am looking forward to potentially opening doors to a new career path as a web developer.
